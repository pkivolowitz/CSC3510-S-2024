# Warmup

This warmup exercise proves to me you have installed the environment and
are ready to continue.

## Steps

* You have already done [this](../install.md#for-the-first-vm-project)

* You have already this [this](../install.md#for-every-vm-project-after-the-above)

* Now you have a VS Code window open on your computer and one open on
the VM. On your computer, navigate to [apple-linux-convergence.S](apple-linux-convergence.S)

* Create the folder "warmup"

* Inside that folder, create the new empty file "apple-linux-convergence.S"
Don't get the spelling wrong

* Copy the code from your computer to the VM. Save it

* Inside the folder, create the new empty file "main.S"

* On your computer, navigate to [change_me.S](change_me.S)

* Copy the code and paste it into "main.S" and save it

* Command or Control J to open a shell window
