* [Apple Silicon](<https://youtu.be/uPXzE_XCZeg>)

* [Windows](<https://youtu.be/8-U7VUypYhY>)

* Intel Mac - get the distro, get QEMU, follow instructions for Windows
  except use your plain old terminal instead of WSL.

* Binary

* Powers of 2 up to 2<sup>16</sup>

* Signed and Unsigned Integers

* 1's Complement and 2's Complement

* Registers

  * Integer Registers w & x

  * Why Have Registers

    * Speed of Processors Relative to RAM

  * *Up to this point was Tuesday 2/6. Thursday's class follows.*

  * Special Registers

    * Program Counter - pc

    * Stack Pointer - sp

  * Floating Point Registers ***h***, s, d, v & q

  * Floating Point Construction

## Week 3 - 2/13 2/15

* Floating Point Registers ***h***, s, d, v & q

  * h are half floats - not used much - are least significant half of
    s's

  * s are single precision values - least significant half of d's

  * d are double precision values - are least significant half of v's

  * v's are a vector of something

  * q's are a single 128 bit value

* Floating Point Construction

  * Floats / Doubles are approximations

  * Normalized scientific notation

    * Sign

    * Exponent

    * Mantissa

  * Single Precision - how above are implemented

  * Double Precision - how above are implemented

* Why Have Registers (Continued)

  * Steps Needed to Execute an Instruction

  * Pipelined Execution

  * Special Registers (other than the *really* special registers)

    * Frame Pointer - x29

    * Link Register - x30

  * Aside:

    * Bit fields in C/C++

    * Unions in C/C++
