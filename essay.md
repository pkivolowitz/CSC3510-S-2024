# What Makes You Think You're Worthy of Computer Science?

This might be the type of essay question students dread.

* I had no idea what the Professor wanted!

* The Professor graded me down because I didn't say exactly what they
  wanted me to say!

And more... but the TL;DR is usually some whining about something
irrelevant when really the student missed the point *behind* the
question.

But maybe this essay is a little different? Or is it?

## What's the "Prompt"?

You've seen it already: "What makes you think you're worthy of Computer
Science?"

You're trying to join **MY** field, **MY** craft, **MY** passion.

What makes you think you're worthy of working in this field?

## How To Answer This Successfully?

I'm not looking for a specific answer.

I'm looking for a specific **kind** of answer.

Here's what's different about this essay:

* You can convene yourselves in any size or number of groups you want.

* Meet as often as you want.

* In the group setting, decide what you think the point *behind* the
question is. **Not what the answer is.** Rather, what's the question
behind the question?

**Then** individually write your essay in your own way.

## Requirements

* Five hundred words plus or minus ten percent.

* Plain text document.

* Zero or close to zero spelling errors.

* Stating anything beyond this provides too much information.

The vagueness you find here is intentional.
